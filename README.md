### Features left to implement

-The ideas i have in mind is adding videos and also some chat bot, making the website more interactive.

## Testing

-Before the documentation i was able to text my pages using light house, with the help of my mentor i 

could fix the the issues i have in the light house.

-The site works well from what i got from light house except for the fact that i was not able to stop the sideways scrolling on the mobile screen size. Otherwise it displays well on other screen sizes.

-All links are working and connecting perfectly.

### Validator testing

-HTML
    -errors were returned when passed through the official [W3C validator] <https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea> but was corrected, now no errors returned.
-CSS
    - errors were not returned initially when testing but before my documnetation i found some errors returned from the official [(Jigsaw) validator] <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator>
    
### Unfixed Bugs
    There are no unfixed bug except getting the mobile screen size correctly

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, i navigate to the Settings tab

- From the source section drop-down menu, i select the Master Branch
  
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

- But sometimes it does not work this way, so i just go to my tab and refresh the page to see my links
